# Integration Explorer

> A lightweight Integration Marketplace prototype for a SaaS import/export platform, allowing users to browse, connect, and configure integrations—all built with React, TypeScript, and Java Spring Boot.

---

##  Highlights  
- **SaaS-aligned**: Simulates in-app integration workflows—authenticating and configuring tools like payment gateways or shipping partners.  
- **Full-stack showcase**: Combines React + TypeScript frontend with Java (Spring Boot) backend.  
- **Ready for production-ready practices**: Includes REST APIs, state management, and unit tests (Jest & JUnit).

---

## ℹ Overview  
**Integration Explorer** lets users:
- Browse available integrations.
- Authenticate/install an integration (simulated).
- Configure integration options.
- Enable or disable integrations as needed.

Built as a starting point for more powerful microservices-based marketplaces, demonstrating real-world SaaS features.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- Java JDK 11+ installed  
- Node.js (v14+) & npm or yarn  
- Git for version control

### Setup & Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/integration-explorer.git
   cd integration-explorer
````

2. **Backend** – Start Spring Boot server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   The API runs at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. **Frontend** – Start React app:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   Your browser opens to `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Explore the app! You can view available integrations, simulate connection/auth, configure, and toggle their status.

---

## Testing

* **Backend (Spring Boot + JUnit)**:

  ```bash
  cd backend
  ./mvnw test
  ```

* **Frontend (Jest)**:

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm test
  ```

Ensure everything runs successfully before sharing or interviewing.

## Demo / Screenshots

*(Add visuals if ready — GIFs or screenshots boost understanding quickly)*
E.g., how to browse integrations, connect, or configure one.

---

## Next Steps

* Implement persistent storage (e.g., PostgreSQL).
* Add real OAuth or API-key flows for authorized integrations.
* Introduce CI/CD pipeline with badges (build status, code coverage).
* Expand UI with integration categories, search, and pagination.
